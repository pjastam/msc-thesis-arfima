# Estimation of time series models

In this chapter we present four techniques for estimation of the models discussed before. The emphasis will be on the performance of these techniques with respect to models of fractionally integrated processes. In
particular, the first three techniques to get an estimate of the fractional order of integration require
a specification of the autoregressive and moving-average structure of the process. Application of the fourth technique as presented in Section 3.3 gives a parameter estimate irrespective of this model structure. This makes it possible to direct the estimate of the integration parameter for long-run modeling purposes only.

The first two estimation techniques which will be discussed in Section 1 lead to estimates of autoregressive and/or moving-average parameters only, i.e. the parameter of integration is supposed to be given. In Section 2 a maximum likelihood estimation technique is discussed which takes into account all parameters simultaneously. The Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) two-stage estimation technique gives an estimation of the parameter of integration _d_ at the first stage (Section 3). The remaining _ARMA_ parameters are estimated at the second stage (Yule-Walker, OLS, ML).
