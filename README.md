# Univariate Fractionally Integrated Time Series Modeling

This repository facilitates the replication of my 1993 [MSc thesis](http://pietstam.nl/mscthesis/) on fractionally integrated time series modeling. Fortran and Matlab were my preferred programming languages back then, for ease of replication I will translate the code to R. The current status of [this book](https://pietstam.nl/msc-thesis-arfima/) is work-in-progress.
