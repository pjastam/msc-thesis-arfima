# msc-thesis-arfima

This notebook is written in order to facilitate (myself and others) to replicate the results of my [MSc thesis](http://pietstam.nl/mscthesis/) on fractionally integrated time series modeling. Back in 1992/1993, the calculations were done in Fortran and Matlab, we now use R for ease of replication.
